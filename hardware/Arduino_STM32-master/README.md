##Background & Support:  
* Based on https://github.com/bobc/maple-asp, which is in turn based on LibMaple by Leaflabs  
* **Please read the wiki (https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki) for full details**
* See also my blog: http://www.rogerclark.net/stm32f103-and-maple-maple-mini-with-arduino-1-5-x-ide/  
* **NEW: Main support site for using STM32 boards with the Arduino IDE: http://www.stm32duino.com/**  
* LeafLabs "Maple Language Reference:" http://leaflabs.com/docs/language.html
* LeafLabs "Maple-Arduino Compatibility:" http://leaflabs.com/docs/arduino-compatibility.html

##Purchase info:  
###Entry level boards

* [Ebay search for "arduino maple"](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&LH_BIN=1&_nkw=arduino+maple&_sop=15) (currently costs <$5 with shipping)
* [AliExpress search for "leaflabs maple"] (http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20150607085526&SearchText=leaflabs+maple)

### Bigger boards (You need to load the stm32duino bootloader)

Some supplier have this board e.g.

*[ STM32F103VET ](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/1PCS-STM32F103VET6-ARM-STM32-Minimum-System-Development-Board-Arduino-M77-/301433302819)

*[There is also a STM32F103ZET board which also works, however they are not always available. They have been listed as "STM32F103ZET6 Minimum System Development Board ARM STM32 Cortex-m3 M75"]
